I don't remember very much. i was housed in the dark most of the time. my only real memory is of being in storage and waiting to be shipped out. there were a lot of us in there. a lot of time clocks i mean. we were all lined up on shelves. all ready to be shipped out. that was a strange for someone as obsessed by time as me, i lost track of time. have you ever lost track of time?
